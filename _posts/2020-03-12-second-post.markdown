This week,
I was hoping to join the BlueBerry crew at their office. 
However, due to my less than stellar communication I missed Richard while he was in Nelson.
He plans to get me acquainted with the workspace and further details this upcoming Tuesday, when he returns.

But I have been working on several things which will help me with main project: 

* Splitting my Laptops Linux partition and installing Window 


    * BlueBerryIT primarilly uses windows, the platform I will be targetting
    
    * I'm able to use the full version of visual studio (Visual studio core omits features such as windows forms)
    
    * Required for the powershell scripts later down the track


* Creation of a windows form app which supports CRUD like functionality for CSV files


    * Practice handling raw data, modifying and keeping changes consistent 
    
    * Practice using a sql database instance as it could be a decent option to store data(if desirable)
    
    * Requires some uncoupling of features, might be able to use some of the ideas in the actual project

(Yes The interface is kinda gross at the moment )


* Research into the XeroAPI 


    * Have set up an account for testing purposes
    
    * Had difficulty creating a 'xero app' via their web interface (Infinite loading) this issue seems to have resolved itself 
      and I can create an app now
      
    * Watched video tutorials and read documentation to start building an understanding on how I might impelement use of their API.
    
    
 * This blog post =) 
 
 
    * Getting into the habit of consistent blogging
    
    * Has served as a good chance to reflect on what I have done / where I am at 
    
    

Come tuesday I'll be diving into the meat and bones of the project and becoming acquainted with how BlueBerryIT operates

Stay tuned for more!
