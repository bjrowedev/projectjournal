I've been having issues porting some of the functionality from .net framework forms to .net core. One particular issue has been getting OleDB to work in the new project.

I was previously using OleDB as  a simple way to map items from the customer invoices csv file provided by CSP to a local database to easily modify and export into a datatable.  However I came to find that OleDB wouldn't work on .net core after several failed troubleshooting attempts such as

changing the builds target environment to 32 bit to hopefully avoid the dependency issues popping up
changing database providers in the connection string, same reason as above

So I eventually gave up on OleDB as an option and implemented the use of a package in visual studio named "CsVHelper"(https://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/) which provided a convenient solution to take the raw text and convert into a datatable for me to work with. This solution is more robust solution than the original because OleDB is a depreciated technology and is also heavier with more type conversions and a local database instance running.
