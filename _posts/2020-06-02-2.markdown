I've been having issues porting some of the functionality from .net framework forms to .net core.
One particular issue has been getting OleDB to work in the new project.

I was previously using OleDB as  a simple way to map items from the customer invoices csv file provided by CSP to a local database to easily modify and export into a datatable. 
However I came to find that OleDB wouldnt work on .net core after several failed troubleshooting attempts such as

- changing the builds target enviroment to 32 bit to hopefully avoid dependency issues
- changing database providers in the connection string, 

So I eventually gave up on OleDB as an option and implemented the use of a package in visual studio named "csv helper" which provided a convenient solution to take the raw text and convert into a datatable for me to work with.
This solution is more robust solution than the original because OleDB is a depreciated technology and heavier with more conversions and a local database instance running.
