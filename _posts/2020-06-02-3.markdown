issues understanding the xero wrapper 

After not being able to send invoices through xero's api wrapper I looked for potential alternatives. I spent some time looking through the xero api docs at .....  I stumbled upon an entry regarding postman.  I learned that postman was a tool used for testing apis through executing web requests.

The xero documentation contained a link a saved configuration setup to test a few basic calls against xeros api



To configure postman, I had to enter xero connection details including

ClientID 
ClientSecret
Callback uri
Scope

  
running the 'request token' feature i was able to retrieve a access token after a browser xero login prompt this token is used in authorizing further api calls
so far pretty similar to the current setup in my application
further features such as  retrieve invoice allowed me to view particular details such as the headers used in the request.. important ones to note such as xero-tenant-id a field i previously did not realize was mandatory for the request. 
Postman also allows the option to view the request as code. The option they presented for c# was a simple method which used restsharp a c# http client, similar enough to the native one for me to understand it pretty much right out the box  this code revealed. important factors such as which headers were actually relevant for the request as postman gives many which may be omitted for my purposes.
