Over the past several days i have been considering the interface of the application, particularly to provide feedback upon making a request so the user knows what information has been posted and if it has been successful One advantage to shifting to an mvc architecture is that the controller can request a specific view for conditions such as the request being successful or not.

For example if a 401 is returned, the controller will display a view informing the client that a connection could not be established
Or, if a 500 error is produced, the controller could return a view explaining that the configuration provided cannot be used to make a request against the xero application

upon sending invoices, I plan to invoices in the response to be defined and stored via the model. This allows the controller to produce a view containing each of the invoices sent and their statuses.
This will allow the end user to verify the completion of the operation and since this is a web page i can format it nicey for better readibilty, thereforr faster verification

As for the design of the view i plan to keep it simple to keep readibily and borrow design elements from bueberry such as
* Color scheme
* Logo To keep a familiar, in house style.

A following blog will detail my implementation of this.
